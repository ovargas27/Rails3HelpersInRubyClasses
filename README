Rails 3 Views Helpers are very useful and save us a lot of work, but yours models should be ActiveRecord::Base child class. In some cases, you don't need to save records in a Database so What happen in this case? Does make sense use ActiveRecord and its overload only to use helpers? the first logic answer is NO.

In this repo we'll create an easy example of how to write Ruby classes compatibles with ActionView helpers.

Hope this may help you
